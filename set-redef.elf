%% 'join' and 'meet' and converted using CPP,
%% but some names do not quite work:

%abbrev union/= = [U] [E:nat`eq N1 N2] union/= U unit`union/ E.
%abbrev intersection/= = [I] [E:nat`eq N1 N2] intersection/= I unit`union/ E.

%abbrev add : set -> nat -> set -> type = [S1] [N] [S2] update S1 N unit/ S2.
